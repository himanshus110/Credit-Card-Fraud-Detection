# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

This Repository includes only the jupyter notebook for credit card fraud detection. You should download the dataset from the link below and then use it in the same folder as the notebook in the repository.

The main objective of this project is to train a model to determine whether a transaction is fraudulent or not.

In this Project, I have analysed the data using Pandas and created visualization using the Matplotlib and Seaborn Library to find out insights and patterns from the data.

The Machine Learning models that I used in this project are Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier.They both are classification algorithms.
