# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

This Repository includes the dataset for credit card fraud detection from kaggle.
Dataset Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud

The main objective of this project is to train a model to determine whether a transaction is fraudulent or not.

In this Project, I have analysed the data using Pandas and created visualization using the Matplotlib and Seaborn Library to find out insights and patterns from the data.

The Machine Learning models that I used in this project are Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier.They both are classification algorithms.
